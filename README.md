# Border-waiting-times---Time-Series-Forecasting-with-LSTM

Mexico-USA border-waiting-time series forecasting using LSTM neural networks. The dataset contains the waiting time and an UTC information format of almost all the sentry lines across Mexico-USA border.

The data was collected from July to October 2017.
